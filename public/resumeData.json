    "bio": "I am a Full Stack Web Developer with a strong interest in projects requiring conceptual and analytical thinking. I enjoy designing and developing websites with end users in mind. I started coding C++ when I was in high school, Later on I learned Java from professional course. When I got the right time to switch career I joined in a coding boot camp, which gave me confidence and experience to present my self as Full stack developer. I don't like to define myself by the work I've done. I define myself by the work I want to do. Skills can be taught but attitude is inherent . I am a multi-talented person with knowledge and experience in different fields especially in telecommunications, networking. I prefer to keep learning, continue challenging myself, and do interesting things that matter. Moreover I am a professional photographer and graphic designer, so I wanted to combine these experiences together and create multidimensional experiences for users.",
